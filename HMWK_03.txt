Programming Assignment 03

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:

  * Demonstrate (elementary) understanding of how to write,
    compile, and run a program in two additional useful languages,
    C and C++.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background:

  * Just two "Hello, world!" programs to ensure that you have a
    working environment for the languages C and C++.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks:

  1. Download hmwk_03_dalioba.zip from Canvas.

  2. Unzip the file somewhere convenient.

  3. Change 'dalioba' in the name of the directory to your NetID.
     (Your NetID is three letters followed by four or five digits.
      The directory name will now be something like
      'hmwk_03_abc1234' but with _your_ NetID in place of
      'abc1234'.)

  4. Look in that directory.

  5. Change the header lines in the files hmwk_03.c / .cc.

      -- Line 1:  Family name first, then a comma, then
                  personal name.

      -- Line 2:  Your NetID.

      -- Line 3:  The date you edited the file, in the format
                  YYYY-MM-DD.

  6. Change line 9 in the hmwk_03.c file to be whatever is
     necessary to print "Hello, world!" followed by a newline when
     this C program is compiled and run.

  7. Change line 11 in the hmwk_03.cc file to be whatever is
     necessary to print "Hello, world!" followed by a newline when
     this C++ program is compiled and run.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Submission:

Make a zipfile of your 'hmwk_03_abc1234' directory (with your
source files in it) and submit it on Canvas as your results
for this assignment.

You can get dinged points for work not in the proper format so
even if your programs work (and work correctly!), you might not
earn full credit.  Check your work!

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hints:
  1. Ensure your programs compile and run correctly.  Not
     compiling or not generating the correct output
     ("Hello, world!" followed by a newline) will cost you points.
     Compare your program output to that shown in the results.txt
     file.  Match it EXACTLY.  ('EXACTLY' means absolutely
     character-by-character the same: those thirteen characters
     then a newline.)

  2. Ensure that you update the three header lines in each of the
     source files with YOUR name (family name first, then a comma,
     then your personal name), YOUR NetID, and the date you edit
     the file (in the format YYYY-MM-DD).

     Not updating the header lines properly will cost you points.

  3. Ensure your submission is packaged EXACTLY as described above.

      -- Your submission should be a ZIP FILE (not a tar, rar, gz,
         or any other kind of compressed file).

      -- The zip file should be named 'hmwk_03_abc1234.zip' (with
         'abc1234' replaced with YOUR NetID).

      -- This zip file should have ONE item in it, a directory
         named 'hmwk_03_abc1234'  (with 'abc1234' replaced with
         YOUR NetID).

      -- Your source files should be in that directory.  The
         source files should be named hmwk_03.c / .cc.

     Submissions in the wrong format score ZERO points.

  4. After you submit your zip file on Canvas, download it
     from Canvas and check that your submission is in the
     proper format, that the programs run and print the correct
     string, and that you updated the header lines correctly in
     each of the source files.

  5. Are you CERTAIN you complied with all of these nit-picking
     instructions?  Really?  Maybe you ought to check just one
     more time. :)
